# NewsBrief
A web app that scrapes the latest news and summarizes them into bullet-point summaries using a fine-tuned BART model.

## Key Features
* **Multithreading & Automated Scraping** Scrapes and summarizes multiple RSS feeds in parallel, on an hourly schedule.
* **Fine-Tuned ML Model:** Generates detailed, concise summaries beyond the base model.
* **Tooltip Feature:** Select text to request definitions or explanations of terms or phrases.

## How It Works
### Data Collection and Preparation
NewsBrief uses multiple datasets with human-generated summaries from Hugging Face and Kaggle. These were combined into a single dataset, preprocessed, and tokenized for training. Each input is prefixed with a task instruction (summarize).

### Model Training
* Dataset Split: 80% training, 20% testing.
* Training uses Seq2SeqTrainingArguments with optimized learning rates and epochs. Seq2Seq Trainer handles training and evaluation. Model performance was measured with *ROUGE scores*, comparing generated summaries with reference summaries.

The fine-tuned model is available here: [Hugging Face: Article Summarizer](https://huggingface.co/Yooniii/Article_summarizer)
