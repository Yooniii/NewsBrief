# NewsBrief
NewsBrief is a website that scrapes the latest news articles from various sources and summarizes them into bullet points using Machine Learning. \\ 
Another cool feature of Newsbrief is a tooltip feature, which was inspired by Notion. The tooltip activates whenever the user highlights text, which allows them to request definitions or explanations of their selected text.
\\
The ML model used to generate the summaries is a model I fine-tuned from the Facebook-Bart-Large-CNN article summarizer on the Hugging Face Library using Google Colab. I decided to revise this model because I noticed the summaries generated by the original model would often be 1-3 sentences in length, lacking detail, and sometimes missing the key highlights of the article. 

# The Process
I revised this model by first scouring the interent to find various datasets with the human-produced summaries I liked. I found four different datasets: three from Hugging Face and one from Kaggle. I ensured all of them contained the original article text along with the summaries, which would act as a reference when training the model.

\\
I combined these datasets into one mass dataset and then created a preprocess function, which is applied to the dataset to parepare it for training and evaluation. This function prefixes the input with the task instruction (summarize) and tokenizes the inputs and outputs (labels).
I split my dataset 80:20 (training to testing) and applied the preprocess function to the dataset using map.
\\
Next, I defined my training arguments (Seq2SeqTrainingArguments), which included the learning rate and optimization, number of training epochs, and logging settings. I also defined the Trainer class (Seq2Seq) which handled the training and evaluation process. In particular, the Trainer class takes in the function compute_metrics as a parameter, which is a function that evaluates model performance.

\\
Compute_metrics takes as input a tuple containing the model outputs (predictions) and desired outcomes (labels). The function processes and decodes the predictions and labels into text, then computes the ROUGE score (round to 4 decimal places) which measures the overlap between the generated summaries (predictions) and reference summaries (labels).

\\

This was my first time with any sort of NLP and ML so there was a lot of researching along every step of the way to understand each component. ML is an area that I am interested to learn more about, and I think this project was a great way for me to become familiar with some of the basic and introductory concepts!

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup (Django)

#### Clone the Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/newsBrief.git
```

#### Create a Virtual Environment
```
cd newsBrief

echo '.env'  >> .gitignore
echo '.venv' >> .gitignore

python3 -m venv venv # create the virtual env

source venv/bin/activate (`venv\Scripts\activate` for Window users) # activate the env

# Install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Set up the database
```
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (admin account for accessing Django admin panel)
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Configure environment variables
```
# Create a .env file in the project root containing your API key to GeminiAI.
API_KEY='YOUR API KEY'
```

#### Run the development server
```
# This will scrape articles from several news sources (in the urls.json file) every minute
python manage.py runserver
```  

### Frontend Setup (React)
```
cd frontend

// Install the required npm packages listed in the package.json
npm install
```

#### Configure environment variables
```
// Create a .env file in the frontend directory with your API key to GeminiAI

// Start the React development server
npm run dev
```

Once both the Django and React development servers are running, you can access the NewsBrief application.
